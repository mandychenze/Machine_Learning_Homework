# Machine_Learning_Homework

Student Name: Ze Chen

Implementation of Machine Learning algorithms using numpy in Python. The exercise was done as part of homeworks given at Columbia's Machine Learning (COMS W4721) class conducted by Dr. John Paisley

The algorithms implemented are:

1. Logistic Regresssion: Steepest Ascent and Newton Method (hw2)
2. K-Nearest-Neighbors Classifier (hw2)
3. Naive Bayes Classifier (hw2)
